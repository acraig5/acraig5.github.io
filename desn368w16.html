            <p style="margin-left:25px">I Liked this site becasue not only was it a architecture website and its layout was not following a certain grid structure that I am use to but it would be something that i would expect an architecture firm to present there work, and use of white space brilliant, Typography little small but your eye focus more to the images which i think the person who created this site inteded to do</p>

        <p style="margin-left:25px"> I liked the scroll effect and carousl animation that allowed myself to not have to use a scroll bar to go right or left also a new way to look at clothing products</p>
